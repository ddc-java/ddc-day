## Overview

**DDC Day** is a GitHub Pages theme, based on [Leap Day](https://pages-themes.github.io/leap-day/) by [Matt Graham](https://twitter.com/mattgraham), customized extensively by [Nick Bennett](mailto:nick@nickbenn.com). It is intended for use in the [Deep Dive Coding](https://deepdivecoding.com) Java + Android Bootcamp, in the publication and distribution of tutorials, lecture notes, homework assignments, practical exam problems, etc.

Markdown (including definition lists and other extensions) is supported by the [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/parser/kramdown.html) parser. Code highlighting is done by the [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/) code highlighter; the current list of language identifiers recognized on fenced code blocks can be found [here](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers). Rendering of mathematical expressions written in $\rm\LaTeX$ is supported by the [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) library.

The published content of this site is intended not only to introduce the **DDC Day** theme, but also to present a basic set of guidelines for writing curricula that will be published in GitHub Pages using this theme. Over time, this content will be expanded into a curricular content style guide for use in the DDC Java + Android bootcamp.
