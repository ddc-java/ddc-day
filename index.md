## Overview

**DDC Day** is a GitHub Pages theme, based on [Leap Day](https://pages-themes.github.io/leap-day/) by [Matt Graham](https://twitter.com/mattgraham), customized extensively by [Nick Bennett](mailto:nick@nickbenn.com). It is intended for use in the [Deep Dive Coding](https://deepdivecoding.com) Java + Android Bootcamp, in the publication and distribution of tutorials, lecture notes, homework assignments, practical exam problems, etc.

The published content of this site is intended not only to introduce the **DDC Day** theme, but also to present a basic set of guidelines for writing curricular content that will be published in GitHub Pages using this theme. Over time, this content will be expanded into a curricular content style guide for use in the DDC Java + Android bootcamp.
