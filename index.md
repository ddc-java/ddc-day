description: "A custom theme for curricular content used in the Deep Dive Coding Java+Android Bootcamp"

## Overview

**DDC Day** is a GitHub Pages theme, based on [Leap Day](https://pages-themes.github.io/leap-day/) by [Matt Graham](https://twitter.com/mattgraham), customized extensively by [Nick Bennett](mailto:nick@nickbenn.com). It is intended for use in the [Deep Dive Coding](https://deepdivecoding.com) Java + Android Bootcamp, in the publication and distribution of tutorials, lecture notes, homework assignments, practical exam problems, etc.

## When to use

This theme is well-suited to a site with 1--6 pages, where each page includes 0--10 headings at levels 1--3.[^1] Inline and block-level $\rm\LaTeX$ blocks may be included, as may extended Markdown features (such as definition lists) supported by the [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/parser/kramdown.html) parser. Code highlighting is done by the [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/) code higlighter; the current list of language identifiers recognized on fenced code blocks can be found [here](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers).

[^1]: More pages and headings may be included; however, displaying a large number of entries in the page navigator or heading navigator implemented in this theme doesn't give very &aelig;sthetically pleasing results.

## When not to use

Given the practical limit on the number of pages of the recommended use cases, this theme should not be used for a site containing a large number of pages (more than 5 or 6). For example, if this theme is to be used for a curriculum module intended for multiple days of instruction, the content should generally be broken down into multiple repositories/sites.
